  <br>

  1. Download the IDE from the button above, or use this <a href="https://learn.co/ide-3/download"> link</a>.
  <br>
  2. The software will download (we promise, it’s safe!)
  <br>
  3. If you are using a Mac, drag the IDE software to your Applications Folder. For more details, check out <a href="http://help.learn.co/the-learn-ide/moving-the-ide-from-downloads-to-applications-folder-for-osx"> this Help Center article</a>. If you’re on Windows or Linux, you don’t need to move the IDE to a specific folder.
  <br>
  4. Open the IDE, and log in with your Learn account. You'll see a temporary directory - that's fine! Check out the image below to see what that looks like. We’ll walk you through how to get started with opening a lab in the IDE in the next lesson.
